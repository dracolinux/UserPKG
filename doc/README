Unprivileged package manager for Linux and NetBSD.

UserPKG is a convenient front-end for pkgsrc, simplifiying the installation and usage of third-party software. No administrator access needed.

Requirements
============

* Linux
* NetBSD
* Build essentials

Status
======

Early Alpha, but usable.

Roadmap/TODO
============

* Check for cvs, if not build.
* Better feedback on pkgsrc sync
* Switch pkgsrc branch
* Check for updates (and list them, and offer to add to queue as update action)
* pause/stop/restart queue (stop works)
* better feedback on build
* save/restore ui
* settings (basic support added)
* startup wizard
* major code cleanup (v1rc2)
* dbus client (v1+)
* binary pkg support (v2+)
* add action support to queue
* add windows/mingw support (v2+)

Install
=======

Download latest release for Linux/NetBSD, or build you own.
