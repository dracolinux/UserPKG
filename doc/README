![alt logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dracolinux/UserPKG/master/res/hicolor/128x128/UserPKG.png)

UserPKG is a convenient front-end for pkgsrc, simplifiying the installation and usage of third-party software. No administrator access needed.

Requirements
============

* Linux (primary testing happens on CentOS6 at the moment, but should work on Slackware and Debian based distros)
 * Qt (only tested on v4.6+)
 * Bash (or proper sh, not dash etc)
 * GNU tar required (during first-run)
 * XZ required (during first-run)
 * NCurses libraries/headers required (yum install ncurses-devel)
* Build essentials (gcc-g++, glibc-devel etc)

Install
=======

```
git clone https://github.com/dracolinux/UserPKG.git
cd UserPKG
git submodule update -i
cd DracoPKG/lib ; qmake CONFIG+=libpkgsrc CONFIG+=staticlib PREFIX=$(pwd)/../build  && make install
cd ../../ ; qmake CONFIG+=libpkgsrc && make
```

```
make install
```

```
make INSTALL_ROOT=/my/custom/location install
```

or just run from folder:

```
./build/UserPKG
```

SlackBuild and spec(RPM) are also available.

Roadmap
=======

* Version 1.0
 * add cron job (check state, sync pkgsrc, check for updates, notify)
 * fix progressbar feedback
 * add pkgsrc sync/update blocker, also not run if bmake runs
 * Switch pkgsrc branch
 * save/restore ui
 * move slow functions (search,list pkgs) to backend thread (added backend)
 * major code cleanup (code has just been added during the alpha run, do a review)
* Version 1.5
 * dbus frontend (aka SysPKG)
  * At this point UserPKG will probably be merged back into DracoPKG, as syspkg and userpkg.
 * NetBSD/FreeBSD support
 * use pkgsrc from github instead of cvs.netbsd.org (?)
* Version 2.0
 * move to libarchive (remove depend on tar+xz)
 * binary package support
